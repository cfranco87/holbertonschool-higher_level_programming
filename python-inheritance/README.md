Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), and Python supports it fully. Inheritance allows you to create a new class (called a subclass or derived class) that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (called a base class or parent class). This enables you to reuse and extend the functionality of existing classes while promoting code reusability and maintainability.
